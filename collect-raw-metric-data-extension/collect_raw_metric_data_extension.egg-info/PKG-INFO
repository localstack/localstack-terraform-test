Collect Raw Metric Data Extension
===============================

All the boilerplate you need to create a LocalStack extension.

## Install local development version

To install the extension into localstack in developer mode, you will need Python 3.10, and create a virtual environment in the extensions project.

In the newly generated project, simply run

```bash
make install
```

Then, to enable the extension for LocalStack, run

```bash
localstack extensions dev enable .
```

You can then start LocalStack with `EXTENSION_DEV_MODE=1` to load all enabled extensions:

```bash
EXTENSION_DEV_MODE=1 localstack start
```

## Install from GitHub repository

To distribute your extension, simply upload it to your github account. Your extension can then be installed via:

```bash
localstack extensions install "git+https://github.com/-/collect-raw-metric-data-extension/#egg=collect-raw-metric-data-extension"
```
